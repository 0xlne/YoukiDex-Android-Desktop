/**
 * StrictDebugMode — a toggleable "make everything loud" mode for bug hunting.
 *
 * The normal crash handler in [com.youki.dex.App] only catches things that
 * already crash (uncaught exceptions). Most of the bugs reported so far
 * (the dockLayoutParams race, the black-screen editor) never actually threw
 * anywhere near the real problem — they failed silently, or the crash
 * happened seconds/minutes after the actual mistake (StrictMode's whole
 * purpose). This makes those visible on demand:
 *
 *   1. StrictMode ThreadPolicy/VmPolicy — flags disk/network on the main
 *      thread, leaked closables (Cursors, streams, the exact class of bug
 *      that caused the MediaMetadataRetriever finalizer timeout crash),
 *      leaked registered receivers/services, and untagged sockets — the
 *      moment they happen, not later when something else notices.
 *   2. logFailure() — a single call point other classes can use to report
 *      a "soft" failure (a null we didn't expect, a player that never
 *      reached STATE_READY, a request that returned but shouldn't have)
 *      that would normally just be a silently-swallowed log line. When
 *      strict mode is on, these get promoted to the same DebugActivity
 *      error screen a real crash shows, with a clear [SOFT FAILURE] tag,
 *      so a glitch is no longer invisible just because nothing threw.
 *
 * Deliberately opt-in via the "strict_debug_mode" switch in the hidden Beta
 * settings screen (unlocked via Developer Mode — 7 taps on the version
 * number in Help & About), OFF by default: StrictMode has real overhead
 * (every disk read on the main thread pays a penalty logging its own stack
 * trace) and is intentionally noisy, which is exactly wrong for a build
 * someone actually uses day to day.
