/**
 * AppFontScaleUtils — scales the font size up/down across **the entire app**,
 * not just app names in the dock/grid (that stays independent in
 * [IconScaleUtils] because it's a different setting in terms of what the user
 * is trying to achieve — "icon label size" versus "every font size in the app").
 *
 * ══ v65 — mechanism change ══
 * Every earlier version of this file (through v64) worked by mutating
 * Configuration.fontScale and handing out a wrapped Context via
 * createConfigurationContext(), applied either in attachBaseContext() for
 * Activities or manually before LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(...) in
 * PerfectServer/DockService.
 *
 * That's the approach Android's own docs point to, but in practice it kept
 * corrupting width/height/density readings once the percentage was anything
 * other than 100% — including on a single physical display with no secondary
 * screen involved. Changing Configuration.fontScale is treated by the
 * platform as a configuration/screen change, which is a much bigger hammer
 * than "resize some text": it can trigger resource re-selection, density
 * recalculation, and — especially for Views built directly via WindowManager
 * outside a normal Activity lifecycle, like the Dock — an inconsistent
 * Configuration snapshot between whatever created the View and whatever is
 * now trying to measure/place it. That mismatch is what showed up as
 * scrambled width & height.
 *
 * Fix: stop touching Configuration entirely. Apply the scale factor directly
 * to each TextView's text size after the layout is already inflated — the
 * same direct approach [IconScaleUtils] already uses successfully for icon
 * size and label size, which was never affected by this bug. No wrapped
 * Context, no createConfigurationContext, no attachBaseContext trickery.
 * Width/height/density are never touched, so they can't get scrambled.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Activities: call [applyToViewHierarchy] on the root view from
 *   onContentChanged() (called automatically after setContentView, no matter
 *   where it's invoked) — see BaseFontScaleActivity.
 * - PerfectServer/Dock: call [applyToViewHierarchy] right after each
 *   LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(...) call, on the inflated root.
