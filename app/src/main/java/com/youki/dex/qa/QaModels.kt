/**
 * QaModels — shared data types for the in-app self-test ("QA sandbox") tool.
 *
 * This is a QA/diagnostics feature, not a testing framework replacement:
 * it walks every known Activity/Fragment, instantiates each one, drives it
 * through a short scripted interaction (rapid start/stop, config-change
 * simulation, common lifecycle edges), and records what happened.
 *
 * The orchestrator/host UI (see [com.youki.dex.qa.QaSandboxActivity],
 * [com.youki.dex.qa.QaTestOrchestrator]) itself runs in a *separate,
 * isolated* ":qa" process (see AndroidManifest.xml). ACTIVITY-kind targets,
 * however, are deliberately launched into the app's real main process, the
 * same one they run in for an actual user — see
 * [com.youki.dex.qa.QaVirtualDisplayHost]'s kdoc, "CROSS-PROCESS CRASH
 * DETECTION," for why that's intentional and how a crash there (which
 * ":qa"'s own in-process exception handler cannot see or catch) is still
 * detected and reported instead of surfacing as a real crash to the user.
