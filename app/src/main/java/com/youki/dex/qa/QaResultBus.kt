/**
 * QaResultBus — in-memory handoff between [QaVirtualDisplayHost] (which
 * actually drives a target and can crash while doing it) and
 * [QaTestOrchestrator] (which is waiting for that outcome). Both run in the
 * same ":qa" process, so a plain in-memory channel is enough — no IPC/
 * Binder/Intent-extras round trip needed, which matters here specifically
 * because the whole point of QaVirtualDisplayHost is to keep working even
 * when the thing it's driving throws from an unexpected callback; a normal
 * onActivityResult return can't be relied on for that.
 *
 * One [Channel] per in-flight run (keyed by a run token the orchestrator
 * generates once per [QaTestOrchestrator.run] call), so results from a
 * stale/leftover host instance from a previous run can never be mistaken
 * for the current one.
